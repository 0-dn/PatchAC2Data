patch-ac2-data v1

This is a small python script to allow you do replace data in the Asheron's Call 2 data files.
It is intended to make skinning the UI easier.

Requirements
============

This uses Python, so you need that installed.  I use Mac OS X, but you can download installers
for windows at <http://python.org/download/>.  You should use the 2.7.3 version.

This also requires the Python Image Library, currently version 1.1.7.  You can download an
installer for Windows at <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>.

*Note* I have not tested this on Windows yet, but it should work in theory :)

Usage
=====

If anything goes wrong, this will probably corrupt your data file, so be sure you keep a copy
of your original data files before using this!
